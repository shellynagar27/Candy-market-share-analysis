## Overview
This project was created as part of the **FP20 Analytics November 2024 Challenge**. It analyzes market share dynamics in the European confectionery industry, leveraging **Power BI for visualization, Python and Power Query for exploratory data analysis (EDA), and Figma for UX design**. Freepik and Flaticon were used for icons.

## Dataset
The dataset originates from a leading European market research company specializing in the confectionery industry. It provides detailed information on major manufacturers, their brands, packaging, and sales volumes within a specific regional market. 

The objective of this analysis is to visualize market trends, conduct category-level analysis, and explore consumption volumes over time. The insights generated will support strategic decision-making for company researchers.

## Key Questions Addressed
This Power BI report aims to answer the following questions:

1. What are the **top 10 candy items by sales volume (weight) in 2022 and 2023**?
